Fri 1-29-21,First meeting with client and HDFS team,"Darvin's notes
 * VN sort of thing
 * progress through a full school day?
 * some other scenarios (others in powerpoint): bullying -- dirty looks; being called on in class
 * art - tova volunteered to draw, jamie said her sister has experience in graphic design, and marisa also said she has undergrad connections she could rope in. may use stock art for now
 * cartoon or realistic? cartoon seems to be more effective based on research
 * VR compatibility - our project will be more of a prototype to get feedback from kids, but if we can choose art that is more amenable to VR (eg art that's somewhere in the middle) that's great
 * what degree of freedom -- should they be able to move around? maybe somewhere in the middle between linear and full freedom. 
 * is there a way to win? marisa doesn't want it to be too much about ""winning"" or it might make kids feel worse.
 * so how do you tell kids whether they've made good responses or not? it would be a bit boring if we just told them straight away ""wrong."" maye if you make too many wrong responses you have to ""go to school again the next day.""
 * we discussed the possibility of a hidden/visible score system and mostly settled on having a ""feelings thermometer.""
 * positive feedback would be great, like positive interactions if you do the right thing
 * how much do we want to show negative feedback? we want them to learn from that, but we don't want to show too much. 
 * maybe you can use deep breathes/mindfulness/tactile playing with things to improve the mood on the thermometer
 * voice acting is a possibility -- marisa has some budget, especially since she will be getting voice acting eventually for the final VR intervention (where kids play VR in a room with a clinician)
 * it's probably not possible to add full CBT stuff into this game -- preparing, going through a single experience, and then debriefing

To do this week:
 * assign team roles (done)
 * set up slack and bot (Ben)
 * set up website (Darvin)
 * prepare individually for Level Design pres -- meet Mon 8:30 PM to finalize
 * start game design process"
Tue 2-02-21,Catching up Prof. Pozefsky,"Darvin's notes
 * prof suggested an after-school segment may allow for more freedom of choice (go to the park, go to the coffee shop, etc.)
 * they should get to choose the avatar/gender
 * what sort of diversity will there be in the characters?
 * is this a NC scope, or across the country? even outside of the US?
 * what differences might there be based on the location of the school? visual, behavioral? (racial makeup, how well-funded the school is...)
 * do they get to personalize other things? (name of school, subjects they takes, clubs they're in, etc.) ask marisa - what seems salient or important?
 * also ask her -- how important is it for the dialog to include the player's name? (is there research on this?)
 * talked about godot vs unity -- she seems fine with godot
 * visual style -- we're considering a generic VN style. prof says innovating in the visual design might not really be worth the time. rather, think about if it appeals to a broad range -- nothing that is very gendered, for example.
 * will the encounters be in the same order every time? (we could have them choose their own schedule.) will they increase in difficulty over time? (probably not)"
Fri 2-05-21,Second client/team meeting (Darvin's notes),"customization of the experience
 * the main experience should be a public, relatively racially diverse school
 * marisa also sees kids from charter schools -- a private/public distinction might be useful
 * there's also regional, class differences -- like dodes the school have metal detectors?
 * could provide three distinct choices of school at the bottom
 * or instead of providing distinct choices, we could adjust various dials based on what the player inputs about themself; the courses they take, the ""climate"", the demographics
 * we all agree that being able to choose the schedule is a good idea.
 * we can even have different experiences for middle and high schools, though we're not sure how that would look yet
 * marisa suggested tailoring experience based on source of stress: biological sources, environmental sources, and high-achieving kids with a lot of stress
 * player could be able to assign someone as a safe person, either explicitly or implicitly (eg. by asking them who they go to for help)

customization of the avatar
 * we like being able to choose age, gender, sexual orientation, skin color at least, even if you can't see them
 * put an emphasis on gender diversity - marisa sees a lot of queer kids
 * can we change what experiences happen based on these choices, like microaggressions? (though we have to be careful not to make it too severe or triggering)

geographical region
 * targeted for america
 * everything is piloted in NC, so it might be fair just to focus on that. but long term has bigger reach.

characters
 * diversity of types of relationships is important -- some teachers/students are kinder or relatable, some are more distant
 * school counselor - primary contact for kids in crisis
 * a handful of teachers -- academic, arts, PE
 * archetypes of peeers -- good friend, bully, someone you have a crush on

misc 
 * logo -- jamie reached out to her sister and she's willing to help. we just need some designs to start off. 
 * title: not sure yet, tova will reach out to dr. m about the title, and if she doesn't know then we can all contribute
 * how much should the feedback for bad choices be? we don't want to PUNISH the player or make them feel bad, right? maybe if they keep making poor choices, we can say ""try taking a deep breath"" or ""try reaching out"" to ease the impact

story
 * adding a large stressor (like prom) may change the experience too significantly
 * but maybe we can add something small to add cohesion and motivate the player to keep playing?
 * maybe it's the FIRST day
 * maybe reentry itself is what's driving the plot
 * having characters reappear and create cohesion that way is also good
 * after school activities? we're asking marisa -- tova guesses it might be better to keep it focused to school.

data collection
 * we can have a report of what choices were made and how the thermometer changed
 * having them do a coping strategy and then asking them if they want to leave or if they feel better -- could be used as a measure if that strategy was effective
 * we should alwasy try to make the choices directed so that we can collect useful data from them

what marisa/the research team will work on
 * surveying the range of high schools (and middle schools!) in NC and what meaningful distinctions we can make between them
 * what customizations to put for avatar and how they should bear out
 * giving us wording for the ""justification for use"" section
 * drafting the script!
 * title!"
,Second client/team meeting (Tova's notes + Marisa's comments),"1) We want the school environment to feel safe, or at least safe enough for the intervention to work without causing too many outliers in the data collection

2) We want the school environment to be somewhat customized, so that students can choose their class agenda/schedule that day. 

3) The user should be able to choose gender (and gender nonconforming identities) as well as race. These choices may determine the experiences that the user has throughout the game/school day
* Going off that note, we want to ensure that our language is carefully chosen, as to not cause unnecessary harm/trauma to the user

4) The game's environment should look like North Carolina and/or that region of the US, and the US in general at the very least 

5) There should be a range of student/adult and student/peer relationships: good, bad, complicated, etc. Perhaps a crush, a bully, a group of ""cool kids,"" a supportive school counselor, a nonchalant teacher, etc. 

6) We need a justification of use. Dr. M is going to provide us with that language, so that we can direct our sights appropriately.
 
7) This is a fairly large age range 13-18 years of age. A day in middle school vs. a day in high school may not look very different in a game, but perhaps the language used, social interactions, and bullying might. 

8) With regards to the user's chosen identity at the beginning of game, we need to ensure that those choices are important to the trajectory of the game in some fashion. What makes identity/character variation so important with regards to how the game itself will be programmed? 

9) What is the most triggering aspect of this simulation? The fact that the user has biologically-driven depression and is entering the school environment? The school environment itself? The interaction of several different personality types/social circumstances faced? 

After Dr. M left, we spoke about: 

10) The logo. Jamie's sister has been so kind as to her offer her services in this respect. What do we want the logo to look like? More importantly, what should the title of this game be? (Hmm, great question. Open to ideas, prefer not to have the word suicide in it though.)

11) Darvin brought up a great point about motivating the user throughout the game--what will this look like? Jamie and Morgan had fantastic ideas about perhaps framing this intervention as a ""first day of school"" or ""first day back after hospitalization"" in order to give the user more encouragement to push past their comfort zone. (Framing it as first day return is perfect.)
* To piggyback off that idea, after hospitalization, many kids at school may be nosey regarding the user's absence. Facing questions like ""Where've you been?"" or ""Are you crazy or something?"" may be good examples of what interactions would look like during the game. (Yep, exactly. I am hoping Jamie, Morgan, and Noelle can start drafting some of the scripts for each of the scenarios I sent in the ppt last week.)

12) With regards to data collection, should every question reflect a metric, or can there be some filler language/scenarios to make the game seem and feel more organic? (No, please add filler. Min. data collection required is once per each scenario.)

13) Morgan came up with a GREAT idea of assigning each user a ""comfort contact."" This person will function as the ""help"" button in any other game, but this person will be someone who regularly interacts with the user as they face their day of challenges. This comfort person can be selected either at the beginning of game or during school day. (Cool!)

14) Wayne brought up a good point: we don't want users to feel like they've made ""bad"" or ""wrong"" decisions. Instead of following up a ""wrong"" decision with more ""wrong"" decisions (as typical of other games), how about we introduce a coping mechanism every time a person chooses a ""wrong"" decision, so that we give the user an opportunity to boost their mood thermometer? In essence, a ""wrong"" decision will just lead to an opportunity to recover. ( Love this idea.)

15) Darvin wanted to ask Dr. M if this intervention was going to extend to afterschool activities, or stay within the confines of the school building? (For dream big, let’s extend it, for minimal pilot, not necessary.)

(I think the other question was about types of coping skills. Here are some examples (and we will want to elicit additional based on practice sessions): coloring book, mindfulness, fidget toy/stress ball, listening to music (could have negative consequences in class), going for a walk, visit to the counselor.)"
Tue 2-09-21,Second instructor meeting,"prof pozefsky wonders if some schools might have better support for mental problems
she suggests you might want to make a point about choosing a good person as the ""safe person."" eg -- asking the player, do you trust them to be discreet? are they a kind person?
names - something related to PrESR? social landmines? clearing landmines? something about the thermomter? (prof worried the thermometer might sound too much like an illness, but i think marisa suggested it) a day in the life? every day the same dream? re-entry/first day? beginning again, first day back, return to school? (send a note to the others with your ideas)
OH AND A TAGLINE
hey the coloring book could actually be a minigame
get some bullet points on the design doc - get it done while you're thinking about it
get godot development up and running - we should all be able to implement basic navigation between screens using buttons"
Fri 2-12-21,Third client meeting -- final meeting of design phase,"research team came with info about high schools!! public, charter, and magnet

jamie did magnet :)
* a public school that focuses on a special purpose -- early college, IB, school of arts, etc.
* main difference is the classes you're required to take -- otherwise it's a normal high school
* in 2021 there were 188 magnet schools, 92 are middle/high

noelle did charter
* similar -- specializes in a special area
* tend to have fewer low-income students and students of color
* noelle's school was very small, everyone knows your business, same teachers three years in a row

morgan did public/typical high schools
* modeled off chapel hill high (a pretty small school)
* has metal detectors, teachers and staff are allowed to search your phone, not as much trust
* social interactions mostly take place at lunch, you can also go to clubs at that time. only 5 minutes to and from classes
* or before first period, you just loiter in hallways and stuff (homeroom is in the afternoon usually)
* gym is required for four years, but you can also take theater or other things
* the least amount of schedule freedom, other than taking APs

so misc stuff about the game...
* school size might be importanat
* transportation -- larger schools may have buses
* player fills out a questionaire about school at the start, along with info about themself (middle/high, class/school size, check off boxes of electives)
* but keep it simple (option to skip?)
* marisa loves the coloring book
* some schools are definitely more equiped to handle mental health problems than others, but a better question to ask might be ""is there an adult you trust?""
* will having an IEP (individualized education plan) matter? most kids wont anyway, and it won't affect the experience much. also re-entry plans also have a lot of the same thinsg as a 504 (accomodation), like a ""pass."" this also goes back to support -- a school that has its act together may offer stuff like this. 
* will the players have the choice of which coping strategy to use? probably, and we could have them actually do the estrategy -- color a book, circle breathing (like headspace), guided meditation
* interns will start divvying up scenes and writing snippets of the script... exciting!!
* Forward!"
Thu 2-18-21 + Fri 2-09-21,End of sprint 1,"prof pozefsky went over the design doc with us -- she'll send written feedback later
		
we had a brief meeting with the research team, who got started on the draft

on the docket for this week:
 * continue writing the draft
 * everyone should commit and pull from the repo to make sure it works
 * choose a vn/narrative framework and lay down the groundwork

to discuss next meeting: make a concrete plan for obtaining assets (ui elements + logo, character art, bg art, music)"
Tue 2-23-21,Middle of sprint 2,"how much variability do we need -- do we make decisions at the scene lever or at a lower level, eg. storing the name of characters as a variable? determines how much we need to implement

what customization do we need -- i suggested we wait until a rough draft and then discuss what can be customized. only do customization that affects the script -- the graphics don't matter as much (except maybe middle/high school)

two decisions: script writing framework and graphical VN framework
* use yarn for the former -- adapt yarn importer for our purposes (handling logic/code, delivering line by line) -- we like the visual editor
* try interfacing it with rakugo (we like rakugo because it contains complex features like skip/history/rollback), but if we run into problems, try to write it from scratch

for next week: try to get yarn and rakugo integrated -- at least clicking through a story and making choices -- and make a decision. also, be familiar enough with yarn to introduce it to the team on friday.

ike: work on yarn presentation
wayne: look more in depth in problems with rakugo
ben: extending godot importer
darvin: make a basic interface between yarn and godot"
Fri 2-26-21,Client meeting,"we decided what we'd do for the rest of the week:
* ben: logic parser
* darvin: line unique ids + starting anywhere in the scene
* wayne: look at saving/loading/hiding
* ike: continue exploring rakugo

NOTE TO SELF: 
BRING UP ART/MUSIC AT NEXT CLIENT MEETING
BRING UP GEEKBOT AT NEXT INSTRUCTOR MEETING"
Tue 3-02-21,End of sprint 2,"SPRINT 3 GOALS

* start on software design doc 
* choose between dynamic and precompiled methods of integrating yarn and rakugo by halfway 
* add yarn resources to the website
* start using slack
* prepare for demo by friday
* (do we NEED rollback and saving within scenes?)
* look into premade visual assets and present to marisa

RESPONSIBILITIES

ben: keep working on yarn syntax parsing
ike and wayne: work on precompiled yarn to rakugo system
darvin: work on dynamic yarn to rakugo interface
ike: look at premade asset availability/costs

END OF SEMESTER GOALS

stock vn functions, mood thermometer, simple customization (wait for more script to be written and rely on marisa's judgement), one minigame"
Fri 3-05-21,Yarn followup meeting + asset talk,"we did some troubleshooting on yarn

and talked about when the soothing minigames will show up -- give them a ui button to use whenever, or will it be specific choices? no decision yet, though marisa likes it being available at all times.

we had a convo about assets and funding - we'll start with free assets for now (ike found a nice character generator) but prepare a list of other options (with prices) to present to marisa so we can decide on the final art assets we'll use

we helped marisa come up with ideas about funding bc she's applying for a grant in order to maybe make a more extended version of the game -- art, voice acting, etc

we went over the yarns wihth the writing team and made sure they were good -- also set up a gdrive for yarn stories"
,Tova's notes,"Notes: 
-You should have all received a new social landmines zoom link from me. Please use that recurring link every Friday (with the exception of next week). Let me know if you didn't receive it, and/or if you feel strongly about meeting on another day next week (Mon-Wed).
-Luckily, we have a budget (up to $10,000) for this project. Allocations should go as follows (with some bend here and there): 
              -artist
              -UI designer
              -voice actor
              -musician 
-As Darvin clarified for us, we should be saving yarn docs as either .yarn or .yarn.text. If you don't have the yarn application, save as .yarn.text. You can open a .yarn.text in notepad
-whenever you want text to come from a specific person, make sure the speaker is clear via ""name:"". Without it, it will just seem like the game is posing questions/comments. 
-we spoke about cartoon vs. life-like images. The cartoon ones are free, and while Ike chose characters with anime-like flare, we ARE able to select different skin colors and other defining features, unique to the user. The life-like images are NOT free. The group preference is towards cartoon, but perhaps finding a different (non-anime?) art form? 
-Darvin mentioned that we are aiming for 3 different emotions/expressions for each character: happy, sad, and one unique to the character (a smirk, friendly smile, etc). 
-Hack: we have to reupload and save as yarn every time we make edits to our yarn project. 
-If we want the name of the user to be inserted elsewhere, enter {$player}
-each sentence of text needs a different line, so that it doesn't look too clustered 
-we are uncertain how to allow the user permissions to type in answers, so for now, we will write: ""type in answer"" in italics
-while there may not be a hard deadline for the cs team to have scripts, we should check with Dr. M. Marisa, what are your tentative goals/deadlines for these scripts? "
