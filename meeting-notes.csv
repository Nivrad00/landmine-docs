Fri 1-29-21,First meeting with client and HDFS team,"Darvin's notes
 * VN sort of thing
 * progress through a full school day?
 * some other scenarios (others in powerpoint): bullying -- dirty looks; being called on in class
 * art - tova volunteered to draw, jamie said her sister has experience in graphic design, and marisa also said she has undergrad connections she could rope in. may use stock art for now
 * cartoon or realistic? cartoon seems to be more effective based on research
 * VR compatibility - our project will be more of a prototype to get feedback from kids, but if we can choose art that is more amenable to VR (eg art that's somewhere in the middle) that's great
 * what degree of freedom -- should they be able to move around? maybe somewhere in the middle between linear and full freedom. 
 * is there a way to win? marisa doesn't want it to be too much about ""winning"" or it might make kids feel worse.
 * so how do you tell kids whether they've made good responses or not? it would be a bit boring if we just told them straight away ""wrong."" maye if you make too many wrong responses you have to ""go to school again the next day.""
 * we discussed the possibility of a hidden/visible score system and mostly settled on having a ""feelings thermometer.""
 * positive feedback would be great, like positive interactions if you do the right thing
 * how much do we want to show negative feedback? we want them to learn from that, but we don't want to show too much. 
 * maybe you can use deep breathes/mindfulness/tactile playing with things to improve the mood on the thermometer
 * voice acting is a possibility -- marisa has some budget, especially since she will be getting voice acting eventually for the final VR intervention (where kids play VR in a room with a clinician)
 * it's probably not possible to add full CBT stuff into this game -- preparing, going through a single experience, and then debriefing

To do this week:
 * assign team roles (done)
 * set up slack and bot (Ben)
 * set up website (Darvin)
 * prepare individually for Level Design pres -- meet Mon 8:30 PM to finalize
 * start game design process"
Tue 2-02-21,Catching up Prof. Pozefsky,"Darvin's notes
 * prof suggested an after-school segment may allow for more freedom of choice (go to the park, go to the coffee shop, etc.)
 * they should get to choose the avatar/gender
 * what sort of diversity will there be in the characters?
 * is this a NC scope, or across the country? even outside of the US?
 * what differences might there be based on the location of the school? visual, behavioral? (racial makeup, how well-funded the school is...)
 * do they get to personalize other things? (name of school, subjects they takes, clubs they're in, etc.) ask marisa - what seems salient or important?
 * also ask her -- how important is it for the dialog to include the player's name? (is there research on this?)
 * talked about godot vs unity -- she seems fine with godot
 * visual style -- we're considering a generic VN style. prof says innovating in the visual design might not really be worth the time. rather, think about if it appeals to a broad range -- nothing that is very gendered, for example.
 * will the encounters be in the same order every time? (we could have them choose their own schedule.) will they increase in difficulty over time? (probably not)"
Fri 2-05-21,Second client/team meeting (Darvin's notes),"customization of the experience
 * the main experience should be a public, relatively racially diverse school
 * marisa also sees kids from charter schools -- a private/public distinction might be useful
 * there's also regional, class differences -- like dodes the school have metal detectors?
 * could provide three distinct choices of school at the bottom
 * or instead of providing distinct choices, we could adjust various dials based on what the player inputs about themself; the courses they take, the ""climate"", the demographics
 * we all agree that being able to choose the schedule is a good idea.
 * we can even have different experiences for middle and high schools, though we're not sure how that would look yet
 * marisa suggested tailoring experience based on source of stress: biological sources, environmental sources, and high-achieving kids with a lot of stress
 * player could be able to assign someone as a safe person, either explicitly or implicitly (eg. by asking them who they go to for help)

customization of the avatar
 * we like being able to choose age, gender, sexual orientation, skin color at least, even if you can't see them
 * put an emphasis on gender diversity - marisa sees a lot of queer kids
 * can we change what experiences happen based on these choices, like microaggressions? (though we have to be careful not to make it too severe or triggering)

geographical region
 * targeted for america
 * everything is piloted in NC, so it might be fair just to focus on that. but long term has bigger reach.

characters
 * diversity of types of relationships is important -- some teachers/students are kinder or relatable, some are more distant
 * school counselor - primary contact for kids in crisis
 * a handful of teachers -- academic, arts, PE
 * archetypes of peeers -- good friend, bully, someone you have a crush on

misc 
 * logo -- jamie reached out to her sister and she's willing to help. we just need some designs to start off. 
 * title: not sure yet, tova will reach out to dr. m about the title, and if she doesn't know then we can all contribute
 * how much should the feedback for bad choices be? we don't want to PUNISH the player or make them feel bad, right? maybe if they keep making poor choices, we can say ""try taking a deep breath"" or ""try reaching out"" to ease the impact

story
 * adding a large stressor (like prom) may change the experience too significantly
 * but maybe we can add something small to add cohesion and motivate the player to keep playing?
 * maybe it's the FIRST day
 * maybe reentry itself is what's driving the plot
 * having characters reappear and create cohesion that way is also good
 * after school activities? we're asking marisa -- tova guesses it might be better to keep it focused to school.

data collection
 * we can have a report of what choices were made and how the thermometer changed
 * having them do a coping strategy and then asking them if they want to leave or if they feel better -- could be used as a measure if that strategy was effective
 * we should alwasy try to make the choices directed so that we can collect useful data from them

what marisa/the research team will work on
 * surveying the range of high schools (and middle schools!) in NC and what meaningful distinctions we can make between them
 * what customizations to put for avatar and how they should bear out
 * giving us wording for the ""justification for use"" section
 * drafting the script!
 * title!"
,Second client/team meeting (Tova's notes + Marisa's comments),"1) We want the school environment to feel safe, or at least safe enough for the intervention to work without causing too many outliers in the data collection

2) We want the school environment to be somewhat customized, so that students can choose their class agenda/schedule that day. 

3) The user should be able to choose gender (and gender nonconforming identities) as well as race. These choices may determine the experiences that the user has throughout the game/school day
* Going off that note, we want to ensure that our language is carefully chosen, as to not cause unnecessary harm/trauma to the user

4) The game's environment should look like North Carolina and/or that region of the US, and the US in general at the very least 

5) There should be a range of student/adult and student/peer relationships: good, bad, complicated, etc. Perhaps a crush, a bully, a group of ""cool kids,"" a supportive school counselor, a nonchalant teacher, etc. 

6) We need a justification of use. Dr. M is going to provide us with that language, so that we can direct our sights appropriately.
 
7) This is a fairly large age range 13-18 years of age. A day in middle school vs. a day in high school may not look very different in a game, but perhaps the language used, social interactions, and bullying might. 

8) With regards to the user's chosen identity at the beginning of game, we need to ensure that those choices are important to the trajectory of the game in some fashion. What makes identity/character variation so important with regards to how the game itself will be programmed? 

9) What is the most triggering aspect of this simulation? The fact that the user has biologically-driven depression and is entering the school environment? The school environment itself? The interaction of several different personality types/social circumstances faced? 

After Dr. M left, we spoke about: 

10) The logo. Jamie's sister has been so kind as to her offer her services in this respect. What do we want the logo to look like? More importantly, what should the title of this game be? (Hmm, great question. Open to ideas, prefer not to have the word suicide in it though.)

11) Darvin brought up a great point about motivating the user throughout the game--what will this look like? Jamie and Morgan had fantastic ideas about perhaps framing this intervention as a ""first day of school"" or ""first day back after hospitalization"" in order to give the user more encouragement to push past their comfort zone. (Framing it as first day return is perfect.)
* To piggyback off that idea, after hospitalization, many kids at school may be nosey regarding the user's absence. Facing questions like ""Where've you been?"" or ""Are you crazy or something?"" may be good examples of what interactions would look like during the game. (Yep, exactly. I am hoping Jamie, Morgan, and Noelle can start drafting some of the scripts for each of the scenarios I sent in the ppt last week.)

12) With regards to data collection, should every question reflect a metric, or can there be some filler language/scenarios to make the game seem and feel more organic? (No, please add filler. Min. data collection required is once per each scenario.)

13) Morgan came up with a GREAT idea of assigning each user a ""comfort contact."" This person will function as the ""help"" button in any other game, but this person will be someone who regularly interacts with the user as they face their day of challenges. This comfort person can be selected either at the beginning of game or during school day. (Cool!)

14) Wayne brought up a good point: we don't want users to feel like they've made ""bad"" or ""wrong"" decisions. Instead of following up a ""wrong"" decision with more ""wrong"" decisions (as typical of other games), how about we introduce a coping mechanism every time a person chooses a ""wrong"" decision, so that we give the user an opportunity to boost their mood thermometer? In essence, a ""wrong"" decision will just lead to an opportunity to recover. ( Love this idea.)

15) Darvin wanted to ask Dr. M if this intervention was going to extend to afterschool activities, or stay within the confines of the school building? (For dream big, let’s extend it, for minimal pilot, not necessary.)

(I think the other question was about types of coping skills. Here are some examples (and we will want to elicit additional based on practice sessions): coloring book, mindfulness, fidget toy/stress ball, listening to music (could have negative consequences in class), going for a walk, visit to the counselor.)"
Tue 2-09-21,Second instructor meeting,"prof pozefsky wonders if some schools might have better support for mental problems
she suggests you might want to make a point about choosing a good person as the ""safe person."" eg -- asking the player, do you trust them to be discreet? are they a kind person?
names - something related to PrESR? social landmines? clearing landmines? something about the thermomter? (prof worried the thermometer might sound too much like an illness, but i think marisa suggested it) a day in the life? every day the same dream? re-entry/first day? beginning again, first day back, return to school? (send a note to the others with your ideas)
OH AND A TAGLINE
hey the coloring book could actually be a minigame
get some bullet points on the design doc - get it done while you're thinking about it
get godot development up and running - we should all be able to implement basic navigation between screens using buttons"
Fri 2-12-21,Third client meeting -- final meeting of design phase,"research team came with info about high schools!! public, charter, and magnet

jamie did magnet :)
* a public school that focuses on a special purpose -- early college, IB, school of arts, etc.
* main difference is the classes you're required to take -- otherwise it's a normal high school
* in 2021 there were 188 magnet schools, 92 are middle/high

noelle did charter
* similar -- specializes in a special area
* tend to have fewer low-income students and students of color
* noelle's school was very small, everyone knows your business, same teachers three years in a row

morgan did public/typical high schools
* modeled off chapel hill high (a pretty small school)
* has metal detectors, teachers and staff are allowed to search your phone, not as much trust
* social interactions mostly take place at lunch, you can also go to clubs at that time. only 5 minutes to and from classes
* or before first period, you just loiter in hallways and stuff (homeroom is in the afternoon usually)
* gym is required for four years, but you can also take theater or other things
* the least amount of schedule freedom, other than taking APs

so misc stuff about the game...
* school size might be importanat
* transportation -- larger schools may have buses
* player fills out a questionaire about school at the start, along with info about themself (middle/high, class/school size, check off boxes of electives)
* but keep it simple (option to skip?)
* marisa loves the coloring book
* some schools are definitely more equiped to handle mental health problems than others, but a better question to ask might be ""is there an adult you trust?""
* will having an IEP (individualized education plan) matter? most kids wont anyway, and it won't affect the experience much. also re-entry plans also have a lot of the same thinsg as a 504 (accomodation), like a ""pass."" this also goes back to support -- a school that has its act together may offer stuff like this. 
* will the players have the choice of which coping strategy to use? probably, and we could have them actually do the estrategy -- color a book, circle breathing (like headspace), guided meditation
* interns will start divvying up scenes and writing snippets of the script... exciting!!
* Forward!"
Thu 2-18-21 + Fri 2-09-21,End of sprint 1,"prof pozefsky went over the design doc with us -- she'll send written feedback later
		
we had a brief meeting with the research team, who got started on the draft

on the docket for this week:
 * continue writing the draft
 * everyone should commit and pull from the repo to make sure it works
 * choose a vn/narrative framework and lay down the groundwork

to discuss next meeting: make a concrete plan for obtaining assets (ui elements + logo, character art, bg art, music)"
Tue 2-23-21,Middle of sprint 2,"how much variability do we need -- do we make decisions at the scene lever or at a lower level, eg. storing the name of characters as a variable? determines how much we need to implement

what customization do we need -- i suggested we wait until a rough draft and then discuss what can be customized. only do customization that affects the script -- the graphics don't matter as much (except maybe middle/high school)

two decisions: script writing framework and graphical VN framework
* use yarn for the former -- adapt yarn importer for our purposes (handling logic/code, delivering line by line) -- we like the visual editor
* try interfacing it with rakugo (we like rakugo because it contains complex features like skip/history/rollback), but if we run into problems, try to write it from scratch

for next week: try to get yarn and rakugo integrated -- at least clicking through a story and making choices -- and make a decision. also, be familiar enough with yarn to introduce it to the team on friday.

ike: work on yarn presentation
wayne: look more in depth in problems with rakugo
ben: extending godot importer
darvin: make a basic interface between yarn and godot"
Fri 2-26-21,Client meeting,"we decided what we'd do for the rest of the week:
* ben: logic parser
* darvin: line unique ids + starting anywhere in the scene
* wayne: look at saving/loading/hiding
* ike: continue exploring rakugo

NOTE TO SELF: 
BRING UP ART/MUSIC AT NEXT CLIENT MEETING
BRING UP GEEKBOT AT NEXT INSTRUCTOR MEETING"
Tue 3-02-21,End of sprint 2,"SPRINT 3 GOALS

* start on software design doc 
* choose between dynamic and precompiled methods of integrating yarn and rakugo by halfway 
* add yarn resources to the website
* start using slack
* prepare for demo by friday
* (do we NEED rollback and saving within scenes?)
* look into premade visual assets and present to marisa

RESPONSIBILITIES

ben: keep working on yarn syntax parsing
ike and wayne: work on precompiled yarn to rakugo system
darvin: work on dynamic yarn to rakugo interface
ike: look at premade asset availability/costs

END OF SEMESTER GOALS

stock vn functions, mood thermometer, simple customization (wait for more script to be written and rely on marisa's judgement), one minigame"
Fri 3-05-21,Yarn followup meeting + asset talk,"we did some troubleshooting on yarn

and talked about when the soothing minigames will show up -- give them a ui button to use whenever, or will it be specific choices? no decision yet, though marisa likes it being available at all times.

we had a convo about assets and funding - we'll start with free assets for now (ike found a nice character generator) but prepare a list of other options (with prices) to present to marisa so we can decide on the final art assets we'll use

we helped marisa come up with ideas about funding bc she's applying for a grant in order to maybe make a more extended version of the game -- art, voice acting, etc

we went over the yarns wihth the writing team and made sure they were good -- also set up a gdrive for yarn stories"
,Tova's notes,"Notes: 
-You should have all received a new social landmines zoom link from me. Please use that recurring link every Friday (with the exception of next week). Let me know if you didn't receive it, and/or if you feel strongly about meeting on another day next week (Mon-Wed).
-Luckily, we have a budget (up to $10,000) for this project. Allocations should go as follows (with some bend here and there): 
              -artist
              -UI designer
              -voice actor
              -musician 
-As Darvin clarified for us, we should be saving yarn docs as either .yarn or .yarn.text. If you don't have the yarn application, save as .yarn.text. You can open a .yarn.text in notepad
-whenever you want text to come from a specific person, make sure the speaker is clear via ""name:"". Without it, it will just seem like the game is posing questions/comments. 
-we spoke about cartoon vs. life-like images. The cartoon ones are free, and while Ike chose characters with anime-like flare, we ARE able to select different skin colors and other defining features, unique to the user. The life-like images are NOT free. The group preference is towards cartoon, but perhaps finding a different (non-anime?) art form? 
-Darvin mentioned that we are aiming for 3 different emotions/expressions for each character: happy, sad, and one unique to the character (a smirk, friendly smile, etc). 
-Hack: we have to reupload and save as yarn every time we make edits to our yarn project. 
-If we want the name of the user to be inserted elsewhere, enter {$player}
-each sentence of text needs a different line, so that it doesn't look too clustered 
-we are uncertain how to allow the user permissions to type in answers, so for now, we will write: ""type in answer"" in italics
-while there may not be a hard deadline for the cs team to have scripts, we should check with Dr. M. Marisa, what are your tentative goals/deadlines for these scripts? "
Tue 3-09-21,Middle of sprint 3,"we presented both the dynamic and precompiled systems, as well as the advanced yarn importer functionality (conditionals, setting variables, jumping, etc)

we chose the dynamic system over the precompiled system because it is easier to integrate with ben's yarn importer work. we'll keep the precompiled version on a separate branch

to do next week (last week of sprint 3)
* ben & darvin: integrate me and ben's systems (using one of the actual scripts, now)
* ike: present update on yarn on friday (jump syntax, character/bg syntax, music, conditionals and variables)
* darvin: fix bugs with vanilla features (rollback crash, save/load crash, skip, text speed)
* customize rakugo's vanilla features/ui (hide/show, volume controls (ike), etc)
* ben & wayne: develop a visual and music system (showing bgs, showing characters with location and facial expression, playing music)"
Tue 3-16-21,End of Sprint 3,"week 4 goals

visual/audio system (ben, wayne)
 + placeholder visuals (ike)

finish debugging/customizing base function (darvin)
 + volume control (ike)

jumping between scenes (darvin)

present advanced yarn features to team (ike)
 + have syntax figured out by then (ben, wayne)
 + maybe start the logo/thermometer design process while we're there

start on mood thermometer (wayne)
 + what orientation? good or bad? 

"
Fri 3-19-21,Client meeting,"scuffed post-meetings notes

ike presented the new syntax, including: show, hide, load, play, jump, if, else, set, and the thermometer (on a scale of 0-100)

ike also showed off some characters and we set up a system for making new characters and emotions

i went over some yarn scripts -- feedback included spacing lines better, making the {$player} more vocal, and using the jump syntax

dr. maraccini said she would find a thermometer she likes for us to use as an example -- generally, up is bad, and there are five colors (green to red) based on how high the thermometer is. she is also interested in experimenting with the player inputting their own mood instead of being told by the game what their mood should be, which is problematic in a clinical setting. she's currently working on a questionnaire to put at the start of the game to determine the initial mood.

dr. maraccini will be reviewing the scripts soon -- she's going to get someone to compile all the yarn scripts into one readable document.

we brainstormed some logo ideas (school, apple, pointer, running person, thermometer) and got the ball rolling with jamie's sister. we'll wait on designing the thermometer until dr. maraccini gets back to us

the research team is going to talk about the order of scenes and linking them together using <<load>>.

i showed off some music samples and volunteered to come up with some ideas for the game. ike volunteered to source some backgrounds.

new responsibilities:"
,Tova's notes,"First, some technical notes: 
-when we want to reveal different characters and scenes, we will now use the 
<<show character name character emotion character orientation on screen>>
For example: 
<<show Chad angry left>>
make sure to leave a space between character name and mood?
Same goes for background (minus the emotion and orientation, since it will be the entire screen):
<<show outside school>>
This will give us some insight into what the visuals will be once we have those established. 

Speaking of--Ike has created a PowerPoint of character designs and has posted it both on the website and drive. If you want to give creating characters a whirl, copy the empty slide template in the PowerPoint and create a new character! If you do that, please save your creations to the drive. 

With regards to finding backgrounds, Darvin pointed us in the direction of two websites: pexels and unsplash. These have free stock images. Ike volunteered to scroll through and find relevant backgrounds (school cafeteria, classroom, hallway, etc), but please feel free to go through these sites as well! If you do save any photos you find, again, please upload to the drive. 

Back to technicals: 
-As Ike showed us in his presentation, we can also assign certain values to characters:
<<set $counselor to ""teacher"">>
OR 
<<set $lunchmoney to 100>>
Teacher is a name, and thus needs """". 100, being a numerical value, does not. Reminder that $ represents a variable name.
Another thing we discussed is ""if, else"" statements. That would go as follows:
<<if $counselor is ""teacher>>
[value|value]
<<else>>
[value2|value2]
 If you would like to see more examples of this, please refer to Ike's uploaded presentation on the drive. 
To hide characters, we simply do: <<hide name of character>>
Example: <<hide Chad>>. Because Chad is just the worst. 
To start/stop playing music: <<play themesong>> and <<stop themesong>> 
At least it's stop for now...

Speaking of music, we learned that Darvin composes music, which just SUPER ROCKS. He played a few samples of his, and we agreed that we need a tune neither too upbeat nor somber. Perhaps the tone will correspond with the mood of the respective scenes? But, also, maybe that would just be too much work. We shall see. Regardless, Darvin has offered to make some samples and present them to us (whenever he is able). THANK YOU! 

We then spoke about the mood thermometer. Dr. M said that she would send a mood thermometer that she likes so that we could have a visual. When determining which ""temperature"" to start with, Dr. M came up the great idea of having each user complete a little questionnaire to assess their state of mind at the start of the game. For example, if the user is really down, the thermometer would start at 100. If they are really up, then 0. So-so=50. And so on. So, our min is 0 and max is 100. 
While we write the script, we should keep that range in mind, so that we can add and subtract an appropriate number of points per question. Dr. M is working on the questionnaire now and will probably send in the near future. 

Reminder to everyone: 
-the lab team has compiled/are compiling a long google doc that just contains txt versions of the yarn files, so that Dr. M can edit them to make them more clinically supported. Once we have those edits, we will need to revamp our scripts in yarn as well. 

Other small technical reminders: 
-Make sure to put | between your answer choice and node choice, or the game will not flow. 
Example: [I'm sad, mom. |sad] 
You can then entitle the next node ""sad""

-If you know the name of the next scene, then enter it when you are finished completing a scene on yarn: 
<<load next scene name>>
Ex: <<load reentry meeting>>

If we have any other technical questions, Darvin and the CS team said we could reach out whenever.

Lastly, we discussed logo. Jamie's sister is a graphic designer, so we may be using her services to help us develop our game logo and thermometer (Thanks, Jamie and her sister!). Ideas for logo: 
-walking/running/moving person
-simplified version of the thermometer (once we've made it)
-a retro green forward arrow 
-simplified school building
-a red apple 

Questions for Dr. M:
-how many emotions should we assign per character? We were thinking 2-3, and we can play with facial expressions on Ike's shared PowerPoint. 
-what should the order of the scenes be? Should they correspond with the order of the scenes in the professional feedback form on REDcap? 

PHEW! Thank you all! Have a great weekend!

Best, 

Tova C. "
Tue 3-28-21,First revisions and overhaul from Dr. M,"Friends: 

 

First off, a big thank you for staying later than our scheduled time today to talk out these new changes. I know there were a lot of them, but there's no doubt that we can make adjustments and eventually make do. ?? 

 

I will first provide notes from my meeting with Marisa, and then provide notes from our meeting today, specifically: 

 

Meeting w/ Marisa Notes: 

-we want to make sure that we don't have a bunch of stressful scenes back-to-back. This involves including some neutral scenes (a hallway with just a few people, mild facial expressions. No need for bullying/stress in every scene). This also makes the game more realistic, because not every experience is (nor should be) stressful. 

-On that note, not every line of every scene should tie back to the user returning from the hospital. Regular HS stuff can be stressful enough, so find a good balance between the two. 

-Here are the major changes: on the preassessment questions, we will be testing for the stressors: social/relationship, academic, and extra-curricular. What the user ranks as most important of the three will either be translated to a bullying or cyberbullying scene later on in the game. The stressor ranked second, will be translated to a bullying or cyberbullying scene later on (depending on which stressor was assigned to which scene before). 

-In this preassessment, we will give users the opportunity to fill out their demographic info and create their avatars accordingly. We may or may not include school demographic information as well. On this note, the names for other players (teacher, peer, etc.) used throughout the game should be ethnically diverse (aka not just Chad). 

-when we present the mood thermometer, we want to make sure the user knows it's for the game, so it's important to label it as a ""game therm"" or ""mood est."" We don't want players changing their mood based on what the thermometer indicates. This thermometer will be shown at all times. 

-There should be a GET HELP button shown on the screen at all times. This will act as an emergency button of sorts. When the user presses this, they will be given a list of resources (national suicide hotline, etc.). 

-There will be core scenes and supplemental scenes. For ex: core scenes are homeroom, crowded hallway, meeting with teacher, cafeteria, etc. Supplemental scenes include a bathroom, a neutral hallway, etc. These aren't essential to the trajectory of the game per se, but they break up stressful scenes. Refer to the document I sent earlier for a scene-by-scene breakdown. 

-the reentry meeting will be at the top of the game. Things that happen in this meeting will determine the trajectory of the game thereafter. For example: if a user doesn't request resources when prompted, they won't receive said resources throughout the game. For example: they could request to leave class 5 mins early to avoid crowded hallways, but if they don't, they will always experience a crowded hallway. Those who ask and receive said accommodations will not experience a crowded hallway. Make sense? 

-There are resources/coping always available to users: bathroom breaks, going to counselor, deep breathing, going to a counselor, teacher, peer at lunch. Alternatively, resources such as coloring in a coloring book or using a fidget spinner are available only to those who request it in the reentry meeting. 

-The conclusion of the game should be something about how the user did during the game. We should discuss in further detail on how this will materialize. 

 

 

Notes from 3/26 meeting: 

-we could use If, then phrases in yarn. For example:

<<If $trigger is ""academics"">>

[]

[]

[]

<<ifelse if $trigger is ""social"">>

[]

[]

[]

<<ifelse if $trigger is ""extra curricular"">>

[]

[]

<<endif>>

 

Notice how we were able to input that all in one node. And to end the sequence, we simply put <<endif>>. Thanks to Ike, this will expedite the process of these changes. A template of these if, else statements in yarn are on the drive (thanks, Ike!). 

 

-our points system will be based on the user's answers to questions about stressors at school. 

-we had a question for Dr. M: what medium will the questionnaire be? Not yarn? If not, what? 

-should the conclusion of the game be a solo experience (game asks user only) or one with user plus faculty and staff at school?

-SIDE NOTE: Jamie's sister will have a logo draft/prototype next week! EEEEK!

 

Thank you all! If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks again for your flexibility and patience!

 

Happy weekend!"
