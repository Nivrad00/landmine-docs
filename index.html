		<p>Darvin's notes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>VN sort of thing</li>
			<li>progress through a full school day?</li>
			<li>some other scenarios (others in powerpoint): bullying -- dirty looks; being called on in class</li>
			<li>art - tova volunteered to draw, jamie said her sister has experience in graphic design, and marisa also said she has undergrad connections she could rope in. may use stock art for now</li>
			<li>cartoon or realistic? cartoon seems to be more effective based on research</li>
			<li>VR compatibility - our project will be more of a prototype to get feedback from kids, but if we can choose art that is more amenable to VR (eg art that's somewhere in the middle) that's great</li>
			<li>what degree of freedom -- should they be able to move around? maybe somewhere in the middle between linear and full freedom. </li>
			<li>is there a way to win? marisa doesn't want it to be too much about "winning" or it might make kids feel worse.</li>
			<li>so how do you tell kids whether they've made good responses or not? it would be a bit boring if we just told them straight away "wrong." maye if you make too many wrong responses you have to "go to school again the next day."</li>
			<li>we discussed the possibility of a hidden/visible score system and mostly settled on having a "feelings thermometer."</li>
			<li>positive feedback would be great, like positive interactions if you do the right thing</li>
			<li>how much do we want to show negative feedback? we want them to learn from that, but we don't want to show too much. </li>
			<li>maybe you can use deep breathes/mindfulness/tactile playing with things to improve the mood on the thermometer</li>
			<li>voice acting is a possibility -- marisa has some budget, especially since she will be getting voice acting eventually for the final VR intervention (where kids play VR in a room with a clinician)</li>
			<li>it's probably not possible to add full CBT stuff into this game -- preparing, going through a single experience, and then debriefing</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>To do this week:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>assign team roles (done)</li>
			<li>set up slack and bot (Ben)</li>
			<li>set up website (Darvin)</li>
			<li>prepare individually for Level Design pres -- meet Mon 8:30 PM to finalize</li>
			<li>start game design process</li>

	<div class='meetingNotes'>
		<p>Darvin's notes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>prof suggested an after-school segment may allow for more freedom of choice (go to the park, go to the coffee shop, etc.)</li>
			<li>they should get to choose the avatar/gender</li>
			<li>what sort of diversity will there be in the characters?</li>
			<li>is this a NC scope, or across the country? even outside of the US?</li>
			<li>what differences might there be based on the location of the school? visual, behavioral? (racial makeup, how well-funded the school is...)</li>
			<li>do they get to personalize other things? (name of school, subjects they takes, clubs they're in, etc.) ask marisa - what seems salient or important?</li>
			<li>also ask her -- how important is it for the dialog to include the player's name? (is there research on this?)</li>
			<li>talked about godot vs unity -- she seems fine with godot</li>
			<li>visual style -- we're considering a generic VN style. prof says innovating in the visual design might not really be worth the time. rather, think about if it appeals to a broad range -- nothing that is very gendered, for example.</li>
			<li>will the encounters be in the same order every time? (we could have them choose their own schedule.) will they increase in difficulty over time? (probably not)</li>

		<p>Second client/team meeting (Darvin's notes)</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class='meetingNotes'>
		<p class="rawNotes">customization of the experience
 * the main experience should be a public, relatively racially diverse school
 * marisa also sees kids from charter schools -- a private/public distinction might be useful
 * there's also regional, class differences -- like dodes the school have metal detectors?
 * could provide three distinct choices of school at the bottom
 * or instead of providing distinct choices, we could adjust various dials based on what the player inputs about themself; the courses they take, the "climate", the demographics
 * we all agree that being able to choose the schedule is a good idea.
 * we can even have different experiences for middle and high schools, though we're not sure how that would look yet
 * marisa suggested tailoring experience based on source of stress: biological sources, environmental sources, and high-achieving kids with a lot of stress
 * player could be able to assign someone as a safe person, either explicitly or implicitly (eg. by asking them who they go to for help)

customization of the avatar
 * we like being able to choose age, gender, sexual orientation, skin color at least, even if you can't see them
 * put an emphasis on gender diversity - marisa sees a lot of queer kids
 * can we change what experiences happen based on these choices, like microaggressions? (though we have to be careful not to make it too severe or triggering)

geographical region
 * targeted for america
 * everything is piloted in NC, so it might be fair just to focus on that. but long term has bigger reach.

characters
 * diversity of types of relationships is important -- some teachers/students are kinder or relatable, some are more distant
 * school counselor - primary contact for kids in crisis
 * a handful of teachers -- academic, arts, PE
 * archetypes of peeers -- good friend, bully, someone you have a crush on

misc 
 * logo -- jamie reached out to her sister and she's willing to help. we just need some designs to start off. 
 * title: not sure yet, tova will reach out to dr. m about the title, and if she doesn't know then we can all contribute
 * how much should the feedback for bad choices be? we don't want to PUNISH the player or make them feel bad, right? maybe if they keep making poor choices, we can say "try taking a deep breath" or "try reaching out" to ease the impact

story
 * adding a large stressor (like prom) may change the experience too significantly
 * but maybe we can add something small to add cohesion and motivate the player to keep playing?
 * maybe it's the FIRST day
 * maybe reentry itself is what's driving the plot
 * having characters reappear and create cohesion that way is also good
 * after school activities? we're asking marisa -- tova guesses it might be better to keep it focused to school.

data collection
 * we can have a report of what choices were made and how the thermometer changed
 * having them do a coping strategy and then asking them if they want to leave or if they feel better -- could be used as a measure if that strategy was effective
 * we should alwasy try to make the choices directed so that we can collect useful data from them

what marisa/the research team will work on
 * surveying the range of high schools (and middle schools!) in NC and what meaningful distinctions we can make between them
 * what customizations to put for avatar and how they should bear out
 * giving us wording for the "justification for use" section
 * drafting the script!
 * title!

		<p>Second client/team meeting (Tova's notes + Marisa's comments)</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class='meetingNotes'>
		<p class="rawNotes">1) We want the school environment to feel safe, or at least safe enough for the intervention to work without causing too many outliers in the data collection
2) We want the school environment to be somewhat customized, so that students can choose their class agenda/schedule that day. 
3) The user should be able to choose gender (and gender nonconforming identities) as well as race. These choices may determine the experiences that the user has throughout the game/school day
          *Going off that note, we want to ensure that our language is carefully chosen, as to not cause unnecessary harm/trauma to the user
4) The game's environment should look like North Carolina and/or that region of the US, and the US in general at the very least 
5) There should be a range of student/adult and student/peer relationships: good, bad, complicated, etc. Perhaps a crush, a bully, a group of "cool kids," a supportive school counselor, a nonchalant teacher, etc. 
6) We need a justification of use. Dr. M is going to provide us with that language, so that we can direct our sights appropriately. 
7) This is a fairly large age range 13-18 years of age. A day in middle school vs. a day in high school may not look very different in a game, but perhaps the language used, social interactions, and bullying might. 
8) With regards to the user's chosen identity at the beginning of game, we need to ensure that those choices are important to the trajectory of the game in some fashion. What makes identity/character variation so important with regards to how the game itself will be programmed? 
9) What is the most triggering aspect of this simulation? The fact that the user has biologically-driven depression and is entering the school environment? The school environment itself? The interaction of several different personality types/social circumstances faced? 
After Dr. M left, we spoke about: 
10) The logo. Jamie's sister has been so kind as to her offer her services in this respect. What do we want the logo to look like? More importantly, what should the title of this game be? (Hmm, great question. Open to ideas, prefer not to have the word suicide in it though.)
11) Darvin brought up a great point about motivating the user throughout the game--what will this look like? Jamie and Morgan had fantastic ideas about perhaps framing this intervention as a "first day of school" or "first day back after hospitalization" in order to give the user more encouragement to push past their comfort zone. (Framing it as first day return is perfect.)
      To piggyback off that idea, after hospitalization, many kids at school may be nosey regarding the user's absence. Facing questions like "Where've you been?" or "Are you crazy or something?" may be good examples of what interactions would look like during the game. (Yep, exactly. I am hoping Jamie, Morgan, and Noelle can start drafting some of the scripts for each of the scenarios I sent in the ppt last week.)
12) With regards to data collection, should every question reflect a metric, or can there be some filler language/scenarios to make the game seem and feel more organic? (No, please add filler. Min. data collection required is once per each scenario.)
13) Morgan came up with a GREAT idea of assigning each user a "comfort contact." This person will function as the "help" button in any other game, but this person will be someone who regularly interacts with the user as they face their day of challenges. This comfort person can be selected either at the beginning of game or during school day. (Cool!)
14) Wayne brought up a good point: we don't want users to feel like they've made "bad" or "wrong" decisions. Instead of following up a "wrong" decision with more "wrong" decisions (as typical of other games), how about we introduce a coping mechanism every time a person chooses a "wrong" decision, so that we give the user an opportunity to boost their mood thermometer? In essence, a "wrong" decision will just lead to an opportunity to recover. ( Love this idea.)
15) Darvin wanted to ask Dr. M if this intervention was going to extend to afterschool activities, or stay within the confines of the school building? (For dream big, let’s extend it, for minimal pilot, not necessary.)

(I think the other question was about types of coping skills. Here are some examples (and we will want to elicit additional based on practice sessions): coloring book, mindfulness, fidget toy/stress ball, listening to music (could have negative consequences in class), going for a walk, visit to the counselor.)
